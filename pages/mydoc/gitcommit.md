Fantastic! Your Git repository is all set up, and now it's time to groove with your changes. Enter the star of the show – `git commit`. This command is like taking a snapshot of your repository at a specific moment, freezing your files' state in time.

**Ready to commit?** Fire up your terminal and hit `git commit`. Don't forget to add a dash of personality with a descriptive message, like: `git commit -m "added new feature"`.

{% include note.html content="Remember, the `-m` flag allows you to add a commit message, a brief explanation of the changes you made. It’s a good practice to include a commit message with every commit." %}

## Checking Out Your Journey

* Want to time-travel through your repository's history? Cue in the `git log` command. It unfolds a tale of all your commits, complete with messages and author details.

    {% include note.html content="This magic command unveils a list of all your commits, spillin' the beans on the changes made, who made them, and when." %}

## Rewind and Replay

Now, for the encore – undoing changes. Git has a couple of tricks up its sleeve:

* **Git Revert:** This nifty command lets you undo a specific commit by creating a new one that does the reverse.

* **Git Reset:** Picture this as your backstage pass to the past. It moves your branch pointer back to an earlier commit, wiping away anything that happened after it.

### What You've Unpacked:

* You've mastered the art of committing changes.
  
* You've unlocked the secrets of commit history.

Well done on conquering these Git essentials! Questions? Drop them in the comments.
