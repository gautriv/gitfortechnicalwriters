Imagine you're working on a project with a team of writers, and you want to use GitHub to track and collaborate on your work. How do you get started?

First, you'll need to set up a repository on GitHub to store your project files. We will talk about setting up a repository later in the course. You can create a new repository from scratch, or you can use a template repository as a starting point.

Once you have a repository set up, you'll need to clone it to your local machine. Cloning a repository creates a local copy of the files on your computer, which you can then edit and modify as you see fit.

As you work on your project, you'll probably want to make changes to the files in your repository. You can do this using any text editor or code editor you like (for example, Visual Studio Code). When you're ready to save your changes, you'll need to commit them to your local repository.

Committing your changes is like taking a snapshot of your work at a particular point in time. When you commit, you'll add a message that describes the changes you've made. This helps you and your team members understand the history of the project and why certain changes were made.

So far, you've only made changes to your local repository. To share your work with your team, you'll need to push your commits to the remote repository on GitHub. Pushing your commits sends your changes to the server, where they can be reviewed and integrated with the work of other team members.

When you push your commits, you can choose to create a new branch or push to an existing branch. A branch is like a separate line of development within your repository. You might create a new branch for a feature you're working on, or for a bug fix.

Once you've pushed your changes to a branch, you can create a pull request to propose your changes for review. A pull request is a way to ask your team members to review your work and consider merging it into the main branch of the repository.

When you create a pull request, you'll be able to see a diff of the changes you've made, and your team members will be able to leave comments and feedback on your code. You can use the pull request to discuss your changes and make any necessary revisions before merging them into the main branch.

That's the basics of the GitHub workflow! It might seem a bit complicated at first, but with a little practice, you'll be a pro at collaborating with your team on GitHub in no time. Just remember: commit often, push early and often, and don't be afraid to create pull requests to get feedback on your work.
