Now that we have our `myfirstgitproject`, let's spice things up by adding another player to the stage – a file named `ReleasesNotes`.

The `git add` command is your backstage pass to the world of Git. It lets you add files to the staging area, a sort of VIP lounge for changes you want to keep tabs on. But before we dive into that, let's cook up a bit more excitement:

1. Cook up two fresh files in your project directory – let's name them **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**.
2. Head over to the terminal and hit the stage with the `git add` command. Specify the files you want to add. For example, for the fresh files, type: `git add file1.txt file2.txt`.

    {% include note.html content="Feeling bold? Use `git add --all` to add all files in the directory. It's like inviting the entire cast to the party! Remember, though, the `git add` command only warms up the stage. The real show doesn't start until you use `git commit`." %}

### Quick Recap:

* You've mastered the art of adding files to your Git repository.

Well done! You're dancing through the Git rhythm. Got questions? Drop them in the comments.
