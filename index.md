If you are reading this, you likely want to either learn Git or evaluate how thorough this course is (perhaps you are an experienced writer or developer). This course is primarily designed for technical writers new to Git, but it can also serve as a review for more seasoned writers. While it may cover some basic concepts for developers, it is not intended primarily for them. Therefore, it may be helpful for developers to consider the content of the course as a whole.

Now that we know our intended audience let’s get started.

Code-as-doc or doc-as-code is not a new concept. It’s been there for a very long; the only thing is that it’s finally getting its due. Git is a piece of software that integrates several elements for doc-as-code concept.

### What is doc-as-code?
Doc-as-code refers to the practice of treating documentation as if it were code, meaning that it is written and managed in the same way that software code is written and managed. This typically involves using version control systems and other tools that are commonly used in software development, such as Git and GitHub, to track and collaborate on documentation.

### What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source version control system that helps you manage and track your source code.

### Do I need both Git and GitHub or GitLab?
Yes!
With Git, you need cloud-based hosting services (GitHub or GitLab) to manage repositories. Confused?

Git keeps track of the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what you have done, albeit locally, since all your Git repositories will be on your local system. That leads to zero collaboration. You would not like to email or Dropbox your content for review, enhancement, and deployment? Would you?

That is where GitHub and GitLab can help. These cloud-based hosting services make collaboration using Git more convenient. You can use them to collaborate among your peers (discuss and update a piece of code or content) and then merge the updates into a single source.
