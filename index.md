If you’re here, you either want to learn Git or review how well I’ve prepared this course (yes, you are an experienced writer or developer). I created this course for technical writers new to Git. If you are a seasoned writer, it can serve as a refresher.

I did not create this course for the Developer community. So if you are a developer, you may find basic things in this course. Therefore, I would suggest that you review this course holistically.

Now that we know our intended audience let’s get started.

Code-as-doc or doc-as-code is not a new concept. It’s been there for a very long; the only thing is that it’s finally getting its due. Git is a piece of software that integrates several elements for doc-as-code concept.

### What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows you to organize and track your source code.

### Do I need both Git and GitHub or GitLab?
Yes!
With Git, you need cloud-based hosting services (GitHub or GitLab) to manage repositories. Confused?

Git keeps track of the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what you have done, albeit locally, since all your Git repositories will be on your local system. That leads to zero collaboration. You would not like to email or Dropbox your content for review, enhancement, and deployment? Would you?

That is where GitHub and GitLab can help. These cloud-based hosting services make collaboration using Git more convenient. You can use them to collaborate among your peers (discuss and update a piece of code or content) and then merge the updates into a single source.
