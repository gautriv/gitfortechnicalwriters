If you’re here, you either want to learn Git or review how well I’ve prepared this course (Yes, you are an experienced writer or developer). I created this course for technical writers new to Git. If you are a seasoned writer, it can serve as a refresher.

I did not create this course for the Developer community. So if you are a developer, you may find basic things in this course. Therefore, I would suggest that you review this course holistically.

Now that we know our intended audience let’s get started.

Code-as-doc or doc-as-code is not a new concept. It’s been there for a very long; the only thing is that it’s finally getting its due. Git is a piece of software that integrates several elements for doc-as-code.

### What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. Git keeps track of the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what you and your peers have done and may roll back to specific versions if necessary. You can use Git to collaborate among your peers (discuss and update a piece of code or content) and then merge the updates into a single source.

### Do I need both Git and GitHub?
### Do I need both Git and GitLab?
Yes!
With Git, you need cloud-based hosting services (GitHub or GitLab) to manage repositories. Confused?

So, Git is a version control system that allows you to organize and track your source code. You can make branches, look over history, and see what you added, edited, or deleted. But, the problem here is everything (the Git repositories) will be on your local system. That leads to zero collaboration. You would not like to email or Dropbox your content for review, enhancement, and deployment? Would you?

That is where GitHub and GitLab can help. These cloud-based hosting services make collaboration using Git more convenient. Allowing multiple writers can work on a piece of content in real-time.

With these services, you can implement project organization and management functions. To keep everyone on track, you may give tasks to individuals or groups, assign rights and roles to collaborators, and employ comment moderation.
